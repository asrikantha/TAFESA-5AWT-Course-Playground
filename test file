5AWT Week 6 Exercise – Version Tracking and GitHub
Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
If you don’t already have a GitHub Account, go to https://github.com to register and then login.
You’ll need an email address to create the account.
Step 2: Create new repository
Click on the “+” on the upper right corner and click “New repository”
Choose appropriate repository name e.g. “TAFESA-5AWT-Course-Playground” and a description.
Initialize the repository with a README.
Click “Create repository”. 
Step 3: Create a new issue
After you are in your newly created repository follow the steps below:
• Go to Issues from the right side-menu
• Click “New Issue”
• Write a simple issue, label it as a bug and assign it to yourself
• Click “Submit new issue”
Click the “issues” button on the right hand side and confirm that the issue is now in the list.
Create another 3 issues and verify that the list stores them all sequentially. 
Step 4: Link a file to an issue
Commit a file to the repository.
Create new issue labelled as a bug and make note of the issue id. You can find the issue id
when you open the issue and look at its title (the number after the # sign).
Change something to the file and commit the changes. In the commit message refer to the
issue id in the format “#issueId – some message here” e.g. “#5 – fixed negative money bug”.
Open the issue and it should mention that it was mentioned from a file commit.
